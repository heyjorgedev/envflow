# Envflow

Envflow is a simple tool to encrypt your env file and share it with your team.

It was built using Laravel, Livewire and Tailwind CSS, so it's easy to use and customize.

It uses [Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) for storing the encrypted env file.

[Upstash Redis](https://upstash.com/) is a serverless cloud-based Redisâ„¢ service that provides high availability, scalability, and security.

It is deployable on [Laravel Cloud](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cloud).
